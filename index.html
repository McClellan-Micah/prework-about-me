      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Â¡Hola! Soy Micah, y me gusta aprender idiomas. Language is the means of communication, and communication is the key to success. 
        So I figure that in order to thrive in the digital age, I should learn as many languages as I can. 
        Whether they be the langauges of men or the langauges of machines. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Mesa, Arizona</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I think soccer is pretty fun. I also enjoy making subpar music.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm trying to figure that part of my life out right now.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>That depends on who's asking.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Becoming a web developer is the first step for me in discovering whether or not I have a passion for computers.</p>
